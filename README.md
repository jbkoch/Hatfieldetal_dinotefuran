Metadata for Hatfield et al. Neonicotinoid pesticides cause mass fatalities of native bumble bees: A case study from Wilsonville, Oregon, USA

Datafile 1

targetbombus.csv 

Metadata

This datafile describes the number of B. vosnesenskii families estimated from genotypes with the software program Colony (Jones and Wang 2010). Family = Unique Identifier, n = the number of randomly sampled B. vosnesenskii individuals to estimate number of unique “families”, total families = the number of families represented in the corresponding sample “n”. The numbers associated with the headers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 represents the number of families represented by 1 individual, 2 individuals, 3 individuals, 4 individuals, 5 individuals, or 6 individuals. For example, for  Target492, there were 153 families that had 2 full siblings (B. vosnesenskii). See Hatfield et al. for citations on these primers once the paper is published.

Datafile 2

target_colony.csv

Metadata

Microsatellite genotypes for 492 B. vosnesenskii females. The loci amplified are B124, B126, B96, BT10, BT30, BTMS0044, BTMS0059, BTMS0062, BTMS0066, and BTMS0083. The loci are described in (Estoup et al. 1995, 1996, Reber Funk et al. 2006, Stolle et al. 2009). See Hatfield et al. for citations on these primers once the paper is published.
